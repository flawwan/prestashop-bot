# prestashop-bot

PrestaShop is a e-commerce solution. There are three modules (described below) that will put hidden objects on the shop that the user can find. For each finding the user will be rewarded with a coupon that can be a free item or a discount.

My goal was to automate the process and remove the human part of the equation.
